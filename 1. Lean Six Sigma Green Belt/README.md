# Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification

## 📦 Lime Warehouse Labor Allocation Planning

🎓 Capstone Project | Foster School of Business, University of Washington  
🟢 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certified | March 2025 - June 2025  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my master's capstone in Supply Chain Management at the University of Washington. The goal was to optimize warehouse labor allocation planning for Lime Commerce Warehouse by developing a dynamic dashboard that forecasts labor needs per process based on historical data trends such as SKU complexity, order types, and shipment data.

> **Impact**: Improved forecasted labor accuracy and reduced idle time by 20% across inbound and outbound activities.
> Improved warehouse labor efficiency through a dynamic, no-code planning tool that forecasted staffing needs using real-time SKU, takt time, and volume trends.
> Replaced static benchmarks with data-driven regression models, enabling agile and function-specific labor allocation across core fulfillment tasks.

## 📊 Key Features
- 📈 **Regression-based labor forecasting** using Excel + multi regression model
- 🔄 **Dynamic dashboards** auto-adjusting by SKU, pieces, pallets and order types
- 🧠 **Model-based and benchmark-based allocation planning**
- 🛠️ **Process visualization**, bottleneck analysis and time study mapping
- 🟢 Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt methodology applied
